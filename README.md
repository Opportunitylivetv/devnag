    The devnag package was originally developed in May 1991 by Frans Velthuis for the University 
    of Groningen, The Netherlands, and it was the first system to provide support for the 
    Devan&#0257;gar&#0299; script for <span class="TEX">T<span class="E">E</span>X</span>. Since 
    then, a dedicated team of developers has maintained and enhanced the package.
