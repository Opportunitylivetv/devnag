Velthuis's Devanagari for TeX

The Devanagari for TeX (devnag) package provides a way to typeset high-quality Devanagari text with 
TeX and LaTeX. Devanagari (&#x0926;&#x0947;&#x0935;&#x0928;&#x093E;&#x0917;&#x0930;&#x0940;) is 
a script used for writing and printing Sanskrit and a number of languages in Northern and Central 
India such as Hindi and Marathi, as well as Nepali.

The devnag package was originally developed in May 1991 by Frans Velthuis for the University 
of Groningen, The Netherlands, and it was the first system to provide support for the 
Devanagari script for TeX. Since then, a dedicated team of developers has maintained and 
enhanced the package. I was heavily involved in the enhancement of the documentation of 
the devnac.c preprocessor and TeX macros, and the expansion of the dvng Metafont by 
creating several new glyphs.

The package is available from the Comprehensive TeX
Archive Network (CTAN), for example at the UK primary site:

  [https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/devanagari/velthuis/](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/devanagari/velthuis/)

In modern TeX systems, such as XeTeX, that natively support Unicode, the devnag.c 
preprocessor is no longer required as Devanagari text can be directly input 
into a TeX document. However, the 7-bit Velthuis transliteration convention offers  
an easy method for representing Devanagari and continues to be used in various 
contexts. A XeTeX extension has been produced using TECkit maps, which enable users
to produce Unicode Devanagari from Velthuis input. Information on this extension 
is available at the project site on CTAN.
